# grapevine

An Instapaper/Pocket-like app that's better at **sharing content** directly with friends or colleagues. Works well as a personal read-it-later tool too.

## Tech stack:
- Python Flask backend (user/friend management, content sharing API*)
- AWS DynamoDB datastore
- ReactJS frontend app
- Chrome browser extension; React-powered (FF + Safari coming soon)
- Hosted on AWS ElasticBeanstalk + S3
